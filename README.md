![GNU Emacs 25.1 running on Ubuntu 16.04.1 with these customizations as of commit 0094809](http://i.imgur.com/faKhZUd.png)
My GNU Emacs configuration settings, originally developed on a Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS system on my HP Envy 17 laptop. It has more traditional keybindings, such as:

| Command           | Keybind   | Description                                                    |
|-------------------|-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `compile`         | `M-x`     | Run `make -k` from the directory of the presently-opened file. |
| `dired`           | `C-S-o`   | Open directory.                                                |
